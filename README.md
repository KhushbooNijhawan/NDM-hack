## Introduction: 
The night time crash rate has hit an all-time high as a result of drivers falling asleep at the wheel and becoming distracted by their phones. Many drivers make the error of listening to music or answering calls while behind the wheel, which has the opposite effect and leaves them feeling drowsy and preoccupied rather than alert.
The issue is caused by the drivers' inadequate local security.

To solve this DorMir is all in one solution in form of a pocket-sized device that can be fitted inside the car along with a mobile application for controlling the device which helps prevent distractions nnd provides smart analytics while driving. Thereby, both time and money are conserved.
